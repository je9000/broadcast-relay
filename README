usage: broadcast-relay [-v] -r 'from to' [-p X]

broadcast-relay relays all UDP broadcast packets received on the 'from'
interface out the 'to' interface, without changing the source or destination
IP addresses (the source MAC is changed to be from the 'to' interface).

-v	Verbose output.
-r	Relay interface names 'from' and 'to' separated by a space.
-p	Only relay this destination port. Can be specified multiple times.
	If -p is not specified, all broadcasts will be forwarded.

Example:
	broadcast-relay -r 're0 em0' -p 12345
